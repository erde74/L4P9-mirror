Usage: usb/umsfs [-dD] [-m mountpoint] [-s srvname] [ctrlno id]

Umsfs serves a directory named mountpoint (default /n/ums) containing
the files ctl or n, where n is the number of the LUN you want to access.
Shown are all LUNs the device says, that it serves and not that are
used. In every LUN directory are the files data and raw. What they do
is shown below:
 - data gives r/w access to blocks of the device
 - raw is a raw scsi-like interface (talk to it with scuzz)

The root directory ctl file does accept the command "reset", which tells
umsfs to reget the information about all LUNs and gives the device geo-
metries when read.

It searches for a device with class=8, subclass=5 or 6, protocol=0x50, or
uses /dev/usb<ctrno>/<id> if specified.

You can format the storage any way you like, but the devices seem to come
pre-formatted with one FAT partition, which you can use like this:

term% usb/usbd
term% usb/umsfs
term% disk/fdisk -p /n/ums/0/data
part dos 7 31559
term% dossrv -f /n/ums/0/data:7 usbstorage
dossrv: serving #s/usbstorage
term% mount /srv/usbstorage /n/d:
term% ls -l /n/d:
alrw-rw-rw- M 39 bill trog 180364 Oct  5 18:14 /n/d:/9LOAD
d-rwxrwxrwx M 39 bill trog      0 Nov 13 14:30 /n/d:/benedict

If there are several partitions, you can use fs(3) to manage them - it
seemed redundant to add partition handling to the umsfs driver itself.
