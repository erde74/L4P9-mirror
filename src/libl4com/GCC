<><><><><> GCC 4.x version problem ? <><><><>

* LP49 has been developed using GCC v3.2 compiler.

* LP49 binary code compiled by GCC 4.x  failed to run !!

* It seems that static variable "th_num_indx" in 
  src/libl4com/l4-tidutcb.c misbehaves with GCC 4.x.

   --- Misunderstanding ?   
   --- Program bug ?, 
   --- GCC bug ? 

* Therefore, libl4com is recommended to be compiled with  GCC V3.2.

* However, recent Linux's includee no  GCC V3.2, 
  To go around with GCC V4.x, tricky coding is applied to src/9/port/syssrv-l4.c. 
  This trivk is hoped to work with GCC V4.x.
