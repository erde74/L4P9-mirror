# ctlr:
# These entries are used to identify a particular controller.
# 'numeric offset'="string" identifies the controller by searching
# the BIOS for "string" at 'offset'. There may be multiple identifier
# attributes per ctlr.
# Strings can be found in the BIOS ROM by using the DOS 'debug'
# command and typing 'd c000:0' to obtain a dump of the first part of
# the ROM. Note that some machines (e.g. AT&T/NCR laptops) have the
# ROM mapped at 0xE0000, not 0xC0000.
# The "clock", "ctlr", "link" and "ramdac" entries give a chain in order
# of functions to be called for this controller for initialisation, etc.
# The "clock", "ctlr", "link" and "ramdac" values can all take an extension
# following a '-'. This can be used as a speed-grade or subtype; matching
# is done without the extension.

# mode:
# These entries specify a monitor operating mode.
# Attributes are:
#	clock		the dot clock in MHz
#	shb		start horizontal blanking
#	ehb		end horizontal blanking
#	ht		horizontal total
#	vrs		vertical refresh start
#	vre		vertical refresh end
#	vt		vertical total
#	hsync		horizontal sync polarity
#	vsync		vertical sync polarity
#	interlace	interlace
# The shb, ehb, ht, vrs, vre and vt attributes specify the horizontal and
# vertical timing. The x (hde, horizontal display end), y (vde, vertical
# display end) and z (depth) values are derived from the value of the main
# attribute (e.g. 640x480x8 -> x=640, y=480, z=8).
#
# The clock value 25.175 is known internally as the baseline VGA clock rate.
#
# The defaults for hsync, vsync and interlace are 0. Both hsync and vsync
# must be non-zero if either is to take effect, - and + are valid choices.
#
# An attribute 'include=val' means continue using another entry. In this
# case any non-zero attributes already set will not be overwritten by the
# jumped-to mode. The x, y and z values are fixed by the first mode.
#
# An attribute 'alias=val' means continue using another monitor type. It can
# be used to chain classes together. (bad explanation, i know).
